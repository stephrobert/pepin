"""Run a falsification: remove a guard in a copy outside the repository, and
require the test that names it to fail.

PORTÉ DEPUIS `github.com/stephrobert/feint` (tools/falsify/falsify.py, Apache-2.0,
même auteur). La doctrine ci-dessous est la sienne, et elle est reprise telle quelle
parce qu'elle a été payée là-bas : trois verdicts invalidés en une journée.

Pépin l'a payée aussi, le 2026-09-08, deux fois dans la même session — un `sed` qui
produisait un nom de champ de structure invalide, et un autre qui laissait un test
passer pour une raison sans rapport. Les deux rouges ont été lus comme des preuves
avant vérification. Ce harnais refuse ce que l'avertissement n'a pas empêché.

    mise run falsify -- tools/falsify/specs/<name>.json

Why this exists as a program rather than as a habit. `/falsify` was a procedure
followed by hand, and on 2026-08-15 the same mistake voided a verdict three
times in one day, across three unrelated issues:

    if ok && fe.EnforcesFirewall() {   ->  if ok {                 # fe orphaned
    if strings.TrimSpace(s) == "" {    ->  if false {              # s orphaned
    if err != nil || n == 0 {          ->  if n == 0 {             # err orphaned

Go refuses to compile an unused variable, so each mutation broke the build. A
mutation that does not build makes *every* test fail, which looks exactly like
the guard being proven — the failure mode `.claude/commands/falsify.md` already
warned about, met three times anyway. Warning was not enough; this refuses.

The rule it enforces, and it is the one that would have caught all three:

    A MUTATION MUST NOT DROP AN IDENTIFIER THE ORIGINAL EXPRESSION USED.

Neutralise a condition by making it never true while every name stays evaluated
(`x && false`, `x == "\\x00never"`, `(err != nil && false) || ...`), never by
deleting the term that mentions it.

The spec is JSON:

    {
      "package": "./internal/cli/",
      "mutations": [
        {
          "label": "the notice never fires",
          "file": "internal/cli/lifecycle.go",
          "find": "if err != nil || health.Resources == 0 {",
          "replace": "if err != nil || health.Resources >= 0 {",
          "test": "TestStopSaysWhatItIsAboutToDiscard",
          "package": "./internal/cli/"
        }
      ]
    }

Per-mutation `package` is optional and falls back to the top-level one.

    to compile, every test in the package fails, and that reads exactly like the

    This is deliberately conservative and says so where it refuses: it cannot
    see the rest of the file, so it flags every name that leaves the fragment,
    including the many that would still compile. Replaying the 0.9 train against
    it found three such: `IncusMinimum` is a package-level var used at four
    other sites, `synthetic` and `health` are locals used further down their own
    functions. All three mutations would have built.

    Refusing them anyway is the trade this tool makes, and the reason is that
    the alternative is worse. The check that would let them through is the
    compiler, which the harness already runs — but by then the copy exists, the
    package is built, and a void verdict has cost what a real one costs. The
    rewrite it demands takes one operator (`&& false`, `|| true`) and produces a
    strictly better mutation: one that changes a truth value and nothing else,

    Two answers, and the second is the one that cost #399. The harness rewrites

    mutation is meant to name one place. A fragment that matches several places
    therefore neutralises one of them and leaves the rest standing — and the
    guard stays green for a reason that has nothing to do with the guard.

    Measured: `shared-layer-is-enforced.json` names

    one call site in internal/providers/exoscale/lostupdate_test.go on the day

    renaming the first, `TestEveryPackRunsTheSharedBarrage` kept reading the
    other two, and the falsification reported STILL GREEN for two months while
    the guard it names was never actually removed. `--lint` could not see it:
    the fragment was still there, so "every declared fragment still applies" was
    true and useless.
